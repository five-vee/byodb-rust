# System Patterns

**System Architecture:**

- The system will initially consist of a single Rust application.
- The application will interact directly with the file system for data storage.

**Key Technical Decisions:**

- Use Rust's standard library for file I/O operations.
- Explore external crates for more advanced file manipulation if needed.

**Design Patterns in Use:**

- None yet.

**Component Relationships:**

- `main.rs`: The main entry point of the application.
