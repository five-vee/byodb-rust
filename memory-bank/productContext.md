# Product Context

**Problem:** The project aims to provide a hands-on learning experience for understanding database internals and the Rust programming language.

**Solution:** Building a database from scratch, following a step-by-step guide, allows for a deep understanding of the underlying mechanisms and challenges involved in database development.

**How it should work:** The database should implement the functionalities described in the guide, starting with file-based storage and gradually incorporating more advanced features.

**User Experience Goals:**

- The project should be easy to follow and understand.
- The code should be well-documented and easy to read.
- The project should be a valuable learning resource for others interested in database internals and Rust.
