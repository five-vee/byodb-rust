**Core Requirements:**

- Implement the database functionalities as described in the guide.
- Use Rust as the primary programming language.
- Follow best practices for Rust development.

**Scope:**

- Initially, focus on the "From Files To Databases" chapter.
- Implement the sub-tasks in the order they appear in the guide.
- Expand the scope as the project progresses and understanding deepens.
